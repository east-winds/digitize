\title{digitize an image}
\usage{
digitize(image_filename, ..., x1, x2, y1, y2, twopoints = F, auto = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{image_filename}{the image file you wish to digitze}

\item{...}{pass parameters col or type to change data calibration points}

\item{x1}{(optional) left-most x-axis point}

\item{x2}{(optional) right-most axis point}

\item{y1}{(optional) the lower y-axis point}

\item{y2}{(optional) the upper y-axis point}

\item{twopoints}{(optional) if true calibrate with two points instead of four. Defaults to FALSE.}

\item{auto}{(optional) if true use automatic digitization. Defaults to FALSE.}
}
\value{
data.frame containing the digitized data (auto=F)

            OR

         spline function as output from splinefun() (auto=T)
}
\description{
digitize an image
}
\details{
Manual procedure (auto=F) proceeds in two steps, both of which require user input
         from the mouse:

           1) Read the image in and calibrate it

           2) Digitize the data

         Calibration points are optionally passed via arguments x1, x2, y1,
         y2. These **must be named in full** if passed.

         If not specified, you are prompted to enter these in the
         console. Note, you donâ€™t need to choose the end points of each axis,
         only two points for which you know the x or y return.

         Automated procedure (auto=T) requires user input in first step only:

           1) Read the image in and calibrate it by clicking on the bounds of the plot

           2) Automatically digitize high-contrast data within the plotting region

         Note: currently auto-digitize does not accommodate multiple lines within plotting region
