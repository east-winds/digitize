\usage{
digitize(
  image_filename,
  ...,
  x1,
  x2,
  y1,
  y2,
  twopoints = F,
  auto = F,
  lines = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{image_filename}{the image file you wish to digitze}

\item{...}{pass parameters col or type to change data calibration points}

\item{x1}{(optional) left-most x-axis point}

\item{x2}{(optional) right-most axis point}

\item{y1}{(optional) the lower y-axis point}

\item{y2}{(optional) the upper y-axis point}

\item{twopoints}{(optional) if true calibrate with two points (SW and NE) instead of four. Defaults to FALSE.}

\item{auto}{(optional) if true use automatic digitization. Defaults to FALSE.}

\item{lines}{(optional) number of lines to extract. Default = 1. Currently works for 1 or 2 lines.}
}
\value{
data.frame containing the digitized data (auto=F)

            OR

         spline function (auto=T)

            OR

         list of spline functions (auto=T, lines=2)

\description{
digitize an image
}
\details{
Manual procedure (auto=F) proceeds in two steps, both of which require user input
         from the mouse:

           1) Read the image in and calibrate it

           2) Digitize the data

         Calibration points are optionally passed via arguments x1, x2, y1,
         y2. These **must be named in full** if passed.

         If not specified, you are prompted to enter these in the
         console. Note, you donâ€™t need to choose the end points of each axis,
         only two points for which you know the x or y return.

         Automated procedure (auto=T) requires user input in first step only:

           1) Read the image in and calibrate it by clicking on the bounds of the plot

           2) Automatically digitize high-contrast data within the plotting region

         For multiple lines (currently works best for red and blue):

					Runs automated procedure twice for different channels, returns a list of interpolation functions
